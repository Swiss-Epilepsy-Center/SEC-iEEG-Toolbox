FILES
*******

Each atlas file defines a 3D VTK mesh of a particular thalamic sub-structure. The stereotactic reference system is derived from Anne Morel’s atlases, which is slightly different from Talairach’s, see the publication and references therein for more details. The origin of the axes is approximately at the center of the Anterior Commissure.

The Atlas is composed of the following files:
AD.vtk
